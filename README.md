# 🧐Intro

After following some tutorials for integrating Okta to React app, I created this demo for playing/testing with features of Okta supplied.

Feel free to use it and welcome any thoughts!

# 🏃‍♂️How to run this project?

As React app run on port 3000 by default, so when creating applications in Okta, suggest to change all '8080' settings to '3000'

1. Create .env file in the root and fill it with OKTA application credentials:

   `cp .env.example .env`

2. Install all the dependencies:

   `npm ci`

3. Run project:

   `npm run`
